Bananas: The star of the cake, youâ€™ll need approximately 4 ripe or overripe bananas.

Flour: Though my recipe is made with whole wheat flour, you can use all-purpose flour or pastry flour.

Leavening ingredients: The recipe has both baking powder and baking soda. For best results, I suggest to use both. Make sure that they are fresh and active.

Oil: A neutral tasting oil works great. But you can use olive oil and coconut oil. You can also use melted butter. I have made the cake with sunflower oil.

Nuts: While walnuts are traditionally mixed into the batter, any halved or crushed nuts can be used.

Dry Fruits: Raisins, cherries, or other dried fruits add extra sweetness to the cake.

Flavorings: My recipes simply has vanilla extract as the key flavoring ingredient. You can add ground spices for warming flavors. Ground cinnamon, cloves, allspice or pumpkin spice make the cake have a lovely aroma.

Optional Ingredients: Coconut flakes, chocolate and other ingredients can be delicious additions to this cake recipe; however, make sure not to overload your banana bread with too many extras
