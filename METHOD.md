1. Mash 4 medium to large ripe or over-ripe bananas with a fork to a smooth consistency. I have used over-ripe bananas for this recipe.

Add Dry Ingredients
4. Sieve 1½ cups of whole wheat flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, ½ teaspoon of baking powder and a pinch of salt directly in the bowl.

TIP: If you do not have a sieve, you can use a fine mesh strainer or whisk.

5. Fold the dry ingredients thoroughly into the wet ingredients. Fold using the cut and fold method. Check my video above or in the recipe card below to see how to form the batter with the cut and fold method.

TIP: Do not mix! If the batter looks too thick, add some water, almond milk or lite coconut milk. The amount of water to be added depends on the quality and texture of the whole wheat flour and the consistency of the batter. Only add in the extra liquids if the batter looks very thick.

8. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean. The timing varies from oven to oven, so keep a note of this.

TIP: If the top of the cake starts browning too much, cover the top with aluminum foil or parchment paper while baking.

SUGGESTION: If you do not have an oven, then bake the cake in a stove-top pressure cooker. Follow the method listed in this detailed post of Pressure Cooker Cake to make this banana cake.

NOTE: The orange-yellowish color in the image is due to incandescent lighting in my kitchen.
